    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. 
        It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, 
        and — in this version — egg yolks. It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. 
        Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle 
        with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!

            Cook over the simmering water, stirring constantly,
