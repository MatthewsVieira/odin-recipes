    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition. 
        We frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker. 
        Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day! 
        Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>

        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
    </ul>
